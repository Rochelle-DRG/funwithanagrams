Hello Rose & Team!

Thank you again for interviewing me. 
This challenge was a lot of fun outside the interview,
and it would NOT have been as enjoyable if I searched for the answer.

When I finished my function I was so proud, I wanted to make an interface 
for you to test it.
Unfortunately it is late now so I really didn't do much with styling beyond that
but I hope you have fun playing with the functionality,
and don't discount the lack of style.

If you would like to see what I can do style-wise, 
let me know, and I will put some actual time (an hour or so) into
it and return it to you.

Here's hoping for a "yes" from Hyland!
Rochelle
